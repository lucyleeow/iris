First, if it is your first time using RAMP, [sign up](http://www.ramp.studio/sign_up), otherwise [log in](http://www.ramp.studio/login). Then find an open event on the particular problem, for example, the event [iris_test](http://www.ramp.studio/events/iris_test) for this RAMP. Sign up for the event. Both signups are controled by RAMP administrators, so there **can be a delay between asking for signup and being able to submit**.\n",

    "Once your signup request is accepted, you can go to your [sandbox](http://www.ramp.studio/events/iris_test/sandbox) and copy-paste (or upload) `estimator.py` from `submissions/starting_kit`. Save it, rename it, then submit it. The submission is trained and tested on our backend in the same way as `ramp_test_submission` does it locally. While your submission is waiting in the queue and being trained, you can find it in the \"New submissions (pending training)\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/iris_test/my_submissions). Once it is trained, you get a mail, and your submission shows up on the [public leaderboard](http://www.ramp.studio/events/iris_test/leaderboard). \n",
    "If there is an error (despite having tested your submission locally with `ramp_test_submission`), it will show up in the \"Failed submissions\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/iris_test/my_submissions). You can click on the error to see part of the trace.\n",

    "The data set we use at the backend is usually different from what you find in the starting kit, so the score may be different.\n",
